========================
Report to printer - Mail
========================

This module fixes the compatibility between the Report to printer and Mail Templates modules.

When generating an email, the report was also printed on the printer.
With this module, the report is not sent to the printer in this case.

Installation
============

This module will automatically install itself when both Report to printer and Email Templates modules are installed.
