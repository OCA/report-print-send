To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Settings > Integrationen > Label-Printers*
#. Add at least one printer as default
#. If using stock or mrp modules, make sure that the connection modules
   zrp_printer_mrp / zrp_printer_stock are available.
#. Best used in combination with a further module, that provides layouts for printers,
   otherwise default-layouts will be used.
