=================
Report To Printer
=================

This module allows users to send reports to a printer attached to the server.


It adds an optional behaviour on reports to send it directly to a printer.

* `Send to Client` is the default behaviour providing you a downloadable PDF
* `Send to Printer` prints the report on selected printer

Report behaviour is defined by settings.


Settings can be configured:

* globaly
* per user
* per report
* per user and report

Installation
============

* Install PyCups - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycups


Configuration
=============

After installing enable the "Printing / Print User" option under access
rights to give users the ability to view the print menu.


Usage
=====

To show all available printers for your server, use the
`Settings/Configuration/Printing/Update Printers from CUPS` wizard.


Then go to the user profile and set the users printing action and default
printer.

Caveat
------

The notification when a report is sent to a printer will not be
displayed for the deprecated report types (RML, Webkit, ...).
