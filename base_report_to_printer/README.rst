This module allows users to send reports to a printer attached to the
server.

It adds an optional behaviour on reports to send it directly to a
printer.

-  Send to Client is the default behaviour providing you a downloadable
   PDF
-  Send to Printer prints the report on selected printer

It detects trays on printers installation plus permits to select the
paper source on which you want to print directly.

Report behaviour is defined by settings.

You will find this option on default user config, on default report
config and on specific config per user per report.

This allows you to dedicate a specific paper source for example for
preprinted paper such as payment slip.

Settings can be configured:

-  globally
-  per user
-  per report
-  per user and report

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

1. Install PyCups - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycups

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get install cups
   sudo apt-get install libcups2-dev
   sudo apt-get install python3-dev
   sudo pip install pycups

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Enable the "Printing / Print User" option under access rights to give
   users the ability to view the print menu.

The jobs will be sent to the printer with a name matching the
print_report_name of the report (truncated at 80 characters). By default
this will not be displayed by CUPS web interface or in Odoo. To see this
information, you need to change the configuration of your CUPS server
and set the JobPrivateValue directive to "none" (or some other list of
values which does not include "job-name") , and reload the server. See
cupsd.conf(5) <https://www.cups.org/doc/man-cupsd.conf.html> for
details.

Usage
=====

Guidelines for use:

   -  To update the CUPS printers in *Settings > Printing > Update
      Printers from CUPS*
   -  To print a report on a specific printer or tray, you can change
      these in *Settings > Printing > Reports* to define default
      behaviour.
   -  To print a report on a specific printer and/or tray for a user,
      you can change these in *Settings > Printing > Reports* in
      *Specific actions per user*
   -  Users may also select a default action, printer or tray in their
      preferences.

When no tray is configured for a report and a user, the default tray
setup on the CUPS server is used.
