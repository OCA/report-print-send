This module allows users to send reports to a printer attached to the
server.

It adds an optional behaviour on reports to send it directly to a
printer.

- Send to Client is the default behaviour providing you a downloadable
  PDF
- Send to Printer prints the report on selected printer

It detects trays on printers installation plus permits to select the
paper source on which you want to print directly.

Report behaviour is defined by settings.

You will find this option on default user config, on default report
config and on specific config per user per report.

This allows you to dedicate a specific paper source for example for
preprinted paper such as payment slip.

Settings can be configured:

- globally
- per user
- per report
- per user and report
