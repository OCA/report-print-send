=====================
ZPL II Label printing
=====================

This module extends the **Report to printer** (``base_report_to_printer``)
module to add a ZPL II label printing feature.

This module is meant to be used as a base for module development, and does not provide a GUI on its own.
See below for more details.

Installation
============

Nothing special, just install the module.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Settings > Printing > Labels > ZPL II*
#. Create new labels

It's also possible to add a label printing wizard on any model by creating a new *ir.values* record.
For example, to add the printing wizard on the *product.product* model :

.. code-block:: xml

    <record model="ir.values" id="wizard_wizard_print_product_label">
        <field name="name">Print Product Label</field>
        <field name="key">action</field>
        <field name="key2">client_action_multi</field>
        <field name="model">product.product</field>
        <field name="value" eval="'ir.actions.act_window,' + str(ref('printer_zpl2.action_wizard_print_record_label_view'))"/>
    </record>

Usage
=====

To print a label, you need to call use the label printing method from anywhere (other modules, server actions, etc.).

.. code-block:: python

    # Example : Print the label of a product
    self.env['printing.label.zpl2'].browse(label_id).print_label(
        self.env['printing.printer'].browse(printer_id),
        self.env['product.product'].browse(product_id))

You can also use the generic label printing wizard, if added on some models.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Add a button to generate the ir.values for a model
* Develop a "Designer" view in a separate module, to allow drawing labels with simple mouse clicks/drags
